                    under the PNL name in 2015, "Que la famille", which thanks to the track
                    "Le Monde ou rien" made the buzz in the rap world. Their clip, as well
                    as all those which they will release thereafter,
                    meet a huge success on the Web, and is viewed by tens of millions of Internet users.

                    Here again, the duo made the buzz with a clip, that of "Oh Lala", shot in
                    Iceland and which exceeded 3 million views in one week.
                    The opus ranked number one the week of its release, and was certified gold
                    in March 2016.

                    which announces a new album, then "DA" in April.

                    a week. The success is even faster than with "Le Monde Chico", since the opus is certified
